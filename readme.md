These notes are an annotated version of the 2025 syllabus, they are incomplete, I tried to do the chapters in order, then got bored and only did the difficult chapters

They are based on the IGCSE CIE Cambridge syllabus

If a note is marked as DONE, it either means that
- I have found and included the information that is demanded by the syllabus
- Found it easy enough to ignore
- Added the information to a flashcard deck

If a note is marked as TODO
- I haven't reviewed the note, and what you see is just what I copied from the syllabus
