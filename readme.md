## For chemistry
Written in Emacs Org mode

These notes are an annotated version of the 2025 syllabus, they are incomplete, 

I tried to do the chapters in order, then got bored and only did the difficult chapters

They are based on the IGCSE CIE Cambridge syllabus

If a note is marked as DONE, it either means that
- I have found and included the information that is demanded by the syllabus
- Found it easy enough to ignore
- Added the information to a flashcard deck

If a note is marked as TODO
- I haven't reviewed the note, and what you see is just what I copied from the syllabus\

## For physics
Written in Emacs Org mode too

exported to LaTeX and converted to pdf through Overleaf

Those notes were written according to one specific exam scope

So the information is far from comprehensive, but of the chapters included, they may be useful
